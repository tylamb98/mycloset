Idea: MyCloset allows users to create and view a closet and outfits in a virtual environment.
Motivation: Having too many clothes can be such drag when it comes to picking out an outfit. Especially when you begin to forget the clothes that you have in your closet. Keeping track of every single article can be such a hassle which is why I believe that having a virtual wardrobe would make picking an outfit not only easier, but more enjoyable as well. I also believe people are becoming less private and a feature such as sharing your closet with others would be interesting. 
Application: MyCloset is a website that allows users to create and save their wardrobe into a public or private closet. Users can adjust the closet any time  adding or deleting items. Public closets are visible to others allowing them to view and follow a Closet to follow along as they change over time. Also, another function would be to link an item to the correlating website in which it can be found. Lastly, users can create and save outfits from their wardrobe saved in their MyCloset.
