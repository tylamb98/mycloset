MyCloset is a website that allows users to create and save their 
wardrobe into a public or private closet. Users can adjust the 
closet any time  adding or deleting items. Public closets are 
visible to others allowing them to view and follow a Closet to
follow along as they change over time. Also, another function 
would be to link an item to the correlating website in which it 
can be found. Lastly, users can create and save outfits from 
their wardrobe saved in their MyCloset.
